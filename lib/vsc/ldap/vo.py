"""
High-level tools for interacting with the HPC LDAP for Virtual Organisations (VO).

The LdapVo class will bind to the LDAP server using LdapQuery, so
there is no need to do this manually.

If this code is extended, it should be Python 2.4 compatible until such time
as all machines where we might require LDAP accesss.

    machines they're running on typically need no more information
    and it is good practice keeping the provided amount of data
    to the minimum required for the the scripts to function in a
