"""
High-level tools for interacting with the HPC LDAP for groups.

The LdapGroup class will bind to the LDAP server using LdapQuery, so
there is no need to do this manually.

If this code is extended, it should be Python 2.4 compatible until such time
as all machines where we might require LDAP accesss.

    machines they're running on typically need no more information
